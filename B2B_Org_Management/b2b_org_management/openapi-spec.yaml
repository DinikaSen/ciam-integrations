  title: B2B Organization Management API
  description: |
    A comprehensive API for managing different types of organizations in a B2B context.
    This API provides a facade over Asgardeo organization management APIs to handle:
    - Managed Organizations (ABB-managed)
    - Self-managed Organizations
    - Sub-organizations
    - Site Organizations
    
    The API handles token switching automatically for sub-organization operations and supports
    server-side filtering with recursive search capabilities for efficient organization listing.
